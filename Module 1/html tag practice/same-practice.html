                It is not your conversation
                That keeps me entertained
                But rather the way you look at me
                That makes me feel sustained
                It's the curve of your lips
                And the curl of your hair
                T'is all of the little things
                That make me stop and stare
                It is not your intelligence
                That drew me close to you
                It is not your sense of humour
                That has thrown me all askew
                It's the touch of your hand
                And the thoughts in your head
                T'is all of the little things
                The things that don't get said
